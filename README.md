# django-endpoint

An end point to run Django services on.

## Installation

This projects uses Gradle (at least version 3.3) as its build system along with
a Docker and docker-compose wrapper for continuous development. On Debian Linux
distributions Gradle can be installed with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cwchien/gradle
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install default-jdk gradle=3.4-0ubuntu1
```

If you prefer to install Docker and docker-compose (highly recommended) refer to
the [official instructions][install-docker-compose].

## Usage

To start the end point get the project and install its dependencies. Once the
migrations have successfully been applied, create the administration panel user,
run the development server and log in at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcbperez/django-endpoint
cd reportservice-flask
sudo gradle dependencies
gradle install
gradle migrate
gradle createSu
python manage.py runserver
```

To add a service module, start by declaring it in `settings.py` and include the
module's URL configuration in `urls.py`.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'myservice',
]
```

```python
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    url(r'^myservice/', include('myservice.urls')),
]
```

## Testing

Tests will be executed by default every time the project is built. To run them
manually start a new build or use Gradle's test task. For a complete list of
tasks check `gradle tasks --all`.

```bash
gradle test
```

A continuous build cycle can be executed with `gradle --continuous` inside a
virtual environment, or with Docker.

```
sudo docker-compose up
```
