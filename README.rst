django-endpoint
===============

An end point to run Django services on.

Installation
------------

This projects uses Gradle (at least version 3.3) as its build system
along with a Docker and docker-compose wrapper for continuous
development. On Debian Linux distributions Gradle can be installed with
the following commands:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cwchien/gradle
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install default-jdk gradle=3.4-0ubuntu1

If you prefer to install Docker and docker-compose (highly recommended)
refer to the `official
instructions <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`__.

Usage
-----

To start the end point get the project and install its dependencies.
Once the migrations have successfully been applied, create the
administration panel user, run the development server and log in at
``http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin``.

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/marcbperez/django-endpoint
    cd reportservice-flask
    sudo gradle dependencies
    gradle install
    gradle migrate
    gradle createSu
    python manage.py runserver

To add a service module, start by declaring it in ``settings.py`` and
include the module's URL configuration in ``urls.py``.

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'myservice',
    ]

.. code:: python

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r'^myservice/', include('myservice.urls')),
    ]

Testing
-------

Tests will be executed by default every time the project is built. To
run them manually start a new build or use Gradle's test task. For a
complete list of tasks check ``gradle tasks --all``.

.. code:: bash

    gradle test

A continuous build cycle can be executed with ``gradle --continuous``
inside a virtual environment, or with Docker.

::

    sudo docker-compose up
